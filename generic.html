									<p>1. Single-cell RNA sequencing. Chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have affected human lives for many years. These diseases are incurable, and causes are unknown. In research with my group, I looked at cell-cell communication between healthy and patients using computational analysis. Cell clustering and cell-cell communication analysis was done through packages in R. We not only confirmed that CXCL is a major pathway in these diseases but also found other significant pathways. Currently, I am working to connect these pathways to potential causes of the diseases and mathematical modeling of the skin diseases.</p>
									<p>2. Analyzing immunotherapy and its Effect on Breast Cancer Growth.  Some cancer cells can avoid immune system detection by producing fewer antigens, producing checkpoint proteins, or by slowing down/stopping the immune response altogether. Immunotherapy, working against these cancerous and harmful cells, utilizes the production of antibodies made in labs. With my teammates, we examined the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs against triple negative breast cancer and the plausibility of its use as a replacement for traditional treatments, namely chemotherapy. We found that a leading factor to consider in predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapies is the number of prior therapies a patient has undergone. The expression of PDL1, a protein expressed by tumors to avoid immune detection, plays a major role in immunotherapy potency, as higher expressions were shown to correlate with higher effectiveness. Literature review was done in this project.</p>
									<p>3. Analysis of the effects of inhibition of Wnt pathways on the proliferation and metabolome of SW480 cells using Mass Spectrometer. The purpose of the research was to determine the role of ibuprofen in tumor inhibition and anlayze relevant biomarkers to understand the effects of inhibiting the Wnt pathway on the metabbolism of SW480 cancer cells. To measure the effect of ibuprofen on cell proliferation, different concentrations of the drug were treated in SW480 cells over time. The raw data was then modeled in Matlab, and it was revealed that ibuprofen does play a role in inhibiting tumor growth. To analyze the metabolic effects of inhibiting the Wnt pathway, data from an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) screen of SW480 cells with Dominant Negative Left Mutation (dnLEF) were used as the dnLEF mutation inhibits the Wnt pathway and thus is a genetic approach to inhibiting tumor growth. Analysis of the cell culture with the MS software allowed us to assess the difference in biomarkers between sample types by quantitating specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) component metabolites in the sample. Putative biomarkers found included acylcarnitines, which are linked to tumor inhibition in colorectal cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that the acylcarnitines caused the mutated SW480 cells to decay by inhibiting tumor growth. </p>
